Woah! Since they lost their Twitter virginity on <%=@user.created_at%>, <%=@user.username%> 
has tweeted <%=@user.num_tweets%> times! It's pretty 
hard to figure out what the first tweet was for a Twitter user who's that active...

</br></br>

Today, <%=@user.username%> has <%=@user.num_followers%> followers, has followed
<%=@user.num_friends%> other users and their latest tweet was "<%=@user.latest_tweet%>" 
at <%=@user.timeoflasttweet%>.
